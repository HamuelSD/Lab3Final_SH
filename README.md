Hello!

In this repo you will find Lab 3 Test Cases and TCI By Step - Samuel Harvey.pdf, which should help show my logic step by step with how I came up with my test cases. Page 1 is my Step 1, using equivalence partitions. Page 2 shows my test cases for a two-point boundary value analysis. Page 3 shows my Decision table analysis, in a format that should mirror how we did it in class, but with the illogical rules removed. Page four has my final test case table with the covered rules from each different step to demonstrate a complete test coverage of tests from each step while still remaining efficient. Page 5 shows my format of the .csv file I used for my test class, which uses the parameterized method shown in class.

Additionally, I used the "ReserveMyPark.java", that was provided by professor Baarsch. In that class he uses a "import com.baarsch_bytes.Exceptions.NightReservationException;" that I have reinstated along with an additional invalid seeking test that looks for negative age values called "InvalidAgeException". These invalid result tests had to be implemented seperately from the .csv implementation of the remaning test cases. That was done in my test file.

Thank you for your time!
