# Lab 3 Submission - Samuel Harvey

Hello!

In this repo you will find **"Lab 3 Test Cases and TCI By Step - Samuel Harvey.pdf"**, which should help show my logic step-by-step with how I came up with my test cases:

* **Page 1:** My Step 1, using Equivalence Partitions.
* **Page 2:** My test cases for a Two-Point Boundary Value Analysis.
* **Page 3:** My Decision Table Analysis (in a format that mirrors how we did it in class, but with the illogical rules removed).
* **Page 4:** My final Test Case Table with the covered rules from each step. This demonstrates a complete coverage of tests while remaining efficient.
* **Page 5:** The format of the `.csv` file I used for my test class, using the parameterized method shown in class.

### Implementation Details

I utilized the `ReserveMyPark.java` that was provided by Professor Baarsch.

In that class, he uses a `com.baarsch_bytes.Exceptions.NightReservationException` that I have reinstated, along with an additional invalid seeking test that looks for negative age values called `InvalidAgeException`.

*Note: These invalid result tests had to be implemented separately from the `.csv` implementation of the remaining test cases. That was done in my test file.*

Thank you for your time!
