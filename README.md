Lab 3 Submission - Samuel Harvey
Documentation: Please refer to "Lab 3 Test Cases and TCI By Step - Samuel Harvey.pdf" for the logical breakdown of my test cases:

  Equivalence Partitions

  Boundary Value Analysis

  Decision Table (Refined)

  Final Consolidated Test Suite (Efficient Coverage)

  CSV File Format

Implementation of Tests: I utilized the provided ReserveMyPark.java. I reinstated the NightReservationException and added a new InvalidAgeException to catch negative age inputs. The testing logic is split into two parts: standard logic is driven by a .csv parameterized test, while specific exception handling (for invalid nights and ages) is implemented in separate test methods within ReserveMyParkTest.java.
